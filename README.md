This is a collection of funny things you can do with spheres. It's still work in progress and will likely be expanded slightly over time. The notebook can be run inside a Jupyter environment kindly hosted by [mybinder.org](mybinder.org). You only need to click the "launch binder" button and wait anywhere between 30 seconds and two minutes.
